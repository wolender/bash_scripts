# [PRACTICAL TASK 3]
# You need to write a script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 such that:
# - If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.
# - If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.
# - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.



for i in {1..100}; do
    
    if (( i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0)); then
        echo "FizzBuzz"
    elif (( i%3 == 0 )); then
        echo "Fizz"
    elif (( i%5 == 0 )); then
        echo "Buzz"
    else
        echo $i
    fi
